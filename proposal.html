    <!-- Problem Statement -->
    <section>
        <p> 
            The topic we have chosen to focus on is music collaboration. There exist a number of music collaboration websites and apps, but many are geared towards professional musicians. An example of this is <a href = "https://www.fiverr.com/" target="_blank">Fiver</a>, which allows users to hire musicians at their own rates to work on projects with them. Although Fiver is an effective platform for its purpose, it does not do a good job to support hobby musicians who arenâ€™t interested in the financial side. Music is a career, but  we noticed that musical apps and websites often neglect to include the hobbyist musician community. As developers, we aim to provide an easy-to-use and functional interface for musicians to collaborate with others without worrying about money. Due to the lack of free, open-source music collaboration web apps, we have decided to develop a solution. 
	        Other sites have already tackled this issue, but there is a noticeable lack of consistency in these solutions. For example, Spotify owns a service called <a href="https://www.soundtrap.com/" target="_blank">SoundTrap</a>, but this is a comprehensive platform with a paid subscription. <a href="https://trackdmusic.com/" target="_blank">Trackd</a> is a social media platform that aims to solve the same problem, and they support easy file sharing and messaging--making them the most similar platform to what we are trying to achieve. Though great solutions do exist that tackle the issue of open-source music collaboration, we aim to focus on creating an open-ended platform that can be used by any musician for any project.

    <!-- Proposed Application -->
    <section>
        <p>
            We are developing a web app that falls under the data collection category. This app will be a music project collaboration website, where users can submit their projects, ask for collaborators, and send collaboration files to other projects. As such, the users of this app will be any musicians looking for collaborators. These users will need to register an account in order to make posts and submit files, but the site can be browsed by anyone on the internet. Users will be viewing project pages that contain audio files representing the current state of the project. They will be able to listen to these audio files in the browser without needing to download them. A given project page will keep track of the collaboration files as well, and the project owner will be able to update the main file if they choose to implement a collaboration file. The primary interactive feature of this app is the ability to upload audio files to a project for the project owner to listen to. When someone uploads a file to their project, they will receive a notification on their account.
